        A laser multiparametric method based on the analysis of the parameters of 
        the deposition zones is presented. The formation of deposition zones on the 
        optical elements of the test-cuvette with the sample occurs during the interaction 
        of volatile substances with laser radiation. Volatile substances are released 
        from materials, elements and assemblies used in sealed volume under the influence 
        of temperature. When the test-cuvette with the sample is heated up to 100 °C, 
        the process of formation of deposition zones is accelerated. In current study, 
        a solid-state YAG:Nd laser with a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz, a pulse duration 
        of 11–14 ns, a radiation wavelength of 1.064 μm, and a pulse energy of 100 mJ 
        was used. The optical, geometric, and color parameters of the deposition zones and 
        their resistance to the action of solvents have been studied. Silicone, activated 
        carbon, and pressed anti-Stokes phosphor were used as samples. It is demonstrated 
        that thin films with specified parameters can be created on the surfaces of optical 
        elements using the laser multiparametric method.
